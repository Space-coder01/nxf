            <div class="risk-warning">
              <h3>Important Risk Warning</h3>
              <p>
                Cryptocurrency markets are dynamic and can experience rapid
                fluctuations. To safeguard investor funds, our trading strategy
                is built on proactive risk management. When market conditions
                fall outside predefined performance expectations, positions are
                promptly exited to protect capital. Our seasoned professional
                traders then carefully monitor the market and re-enter only when
                conditions align with strategic opportunities.
              </p>
              <p>
                Investor protection remains our top priority. Advanced stop-loss
                mechanisms are continuously enforced to limit exposure and
                control downside risk. These controls are designed to pause
                trading activity as price movements approach the invested
                capital level, ensuring disciplined decision-making, controlled
                risk, and a strong focus on capital preservation.
              </p>
            </div>

            <h3>5.1 Market Risks</h3>
            <p>
              Cryptocurrency markets are inherently dynamic and can change
              rapidly. While advanced risk controls are in place, investors
              should be aware of the following market-related factors:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Price Volatility:</strong> Digital asset prices may
                experience sharp movements within short timeframes; however,
                positions are actively managed and exited when conditions fall
                outside predefined performance thresholds.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Market Conditions:</strong> Broader market trends may
                influence trading opportunities, which is why capital is only
                deployed when conditions align with our strategic criteria.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Liquidity Considerations:</strong> In certain market
                environments, liquidity may fluctuate, and trades are executed
                with disciplined timing to support capital preservation.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Regulatory Environment:</strong> Regulatory developments
                may impact cryptocurrency markets and trading operations.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>5.2 Operational Risks</h3>
            <p>
              We operate using secure, industry-standard systems and procedures;
              however, operational risks may still arise:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Technology Risk:</strong> Temporary system interruptions
                or technical issues may occur despite ongoing maintenance and
                monitoring.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Cybersecurity Risk:</strong> Robust security measures
                are implemented to protect data and assets.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Third-Party Dependencies:</strong> Certain services rely
                on trusted third-party providers whose performance may impact
                overall operations.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>5.3 Acknowledgment of Risk Management Approach</h3>
            <p>By using our services, you acknowledge and understand that:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                All trading activities are governed by strict risk management
                and stop-loss controls designed to protect invested capital.
              </li>
              <li>
                Funds are proactively withdrawn from active positions when
                market conditions do not meet established risk parameters.
              </li>
              <li>
                Professional traders and experienced risk managers oversee all
                trading decisions with a focus on disciplined execution and
                capital preservation.
              </li>
              <li>
                While no market activity is entirely free from risk, our
                structured approach prioritizes controlled exposure and
                responsible investment practices.

            <h3>11.2 Termination by Us</h3>
            <p>
              We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your account

            <h3>12.1 Informal Resolution</h3>
            <p>
              If you have any dispute with us, you agree to first contact our
              customer support team to attempt an informal resolution. Most
              disputes can be resolved quickly and efficiently through this
              process.

            <h3>12.2 Arbitration Agreement</h3>
            <p>
              If informal resolution is unsuccessful, any dispute arising from
              these terms or your use of the Platform shall be resolved through
              binding arbitration rather than in court, except where prohibited
              by law.

            <h3>12.3 Class Action Waiver</h3>
            <p>
              YOU AGREE THAT DISPUTES WILL BE RESOLVED INDIVIDUALLY, NOT AS A
              CLASS ACTION OR COLLECTIVE PROCEEDING. You waive any right to
              participate in class action lawsuits or class-wide arbitration.

            <p>
              These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with
              the laws of the jurisdiction in which Nexus Investment FX is
              registered, without regard to conflict of law principles.
